[init] Using Kubernetes version: v1.27.1
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks
error execution phase preflight: [preflight] Some fatal errors occurred:
	[ERROR FileContent--proc-sys-net-bridge-bridge-nf-call-iptables]: /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables does not exist
[preflight] If you know what you are doing, you can make a check non-fatal with `--ignore-preflight-errors=...`
To see the stack trace of this error execute with --v=5 or higher


The error message you encountered indicates that the file /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables does not exist on your system. This file is required by Kubernetes during the pre-flight checks.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

Check if the bridge-nf-call-iptables module is loaded. Run the following command:

sudo lsmod | grep br_netfilter

If it returns no output, you need to load the module by running:
sudo modprobe br_netfilter
If the module was successfully loaded, try running the kubeadm init command again. If the issue persists, proceed to the next step.

Check if the bridge-nf-call-iptables sysctl parameter is set. Run the following command:

sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables
If it returns net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 0, you need to enable it by running:

sudo sysctl -w net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1

    Retry running the kubeadm init command.

These steps should help resolve the issue related to /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables not existing.
